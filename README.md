# Graphical Modelling Using LASSO## OverviewThis project implements graphical modelling using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) for both simulated and empirical datasets. The scripts includes data simulation, processing, graphical model construction, and evaluation. The project is structured to support reproducible research, ensuring that results can be replicated with ease.## Author- **Name**: Jens van Drunen- **Affiliation**: Erasmus University Rotterdam- **Email**: 572793fd@eur.nl## Project Structure- `main.py`: Entry point of the project- `simulation.py`: Contains functions for generating simulated datasets.- `data_processing.py`: Functions for processing empirical datasets (SMC and METABRIC).- `graphical_modelling.py`: LASSO-based graphical modelling functionalities.- `graph_drawing.py`: Functions for constructing and visualising graphs.- `evaluation.py`: Functions for evaluating the performance of graphical models.- `usage.py`: Integrates various functionalities to generate concrete results.## Prerequisites- Python 3.6+- Required packages (install via `pip`):  - numpy  - pandas  - scikit-learn  - networkx  - matplotlib  - seaborn  - tqdm  - openpyxl     ## Usage
